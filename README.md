# FinalProject
Anastasia Lee - AP CS Final Project
# Purpose
This program allows the user to create a to-do list, composed of the task name and its deadline (number of days until due date). The list can then be encrypted and decrypted using the Caesar shift. Additionally, users can sort the list by alphabetical order (using insertion sort) or by deadline (using selection sort).
# How to use
Run the FinalProject.java file (which contains the main method). A numbered menu of options will appear. Entering 1 allows you to add a task to the list by inputting the name and deadline. Entering 2 allows you to encrypt all the task names and entering 3 allows you to decrypt all the task names, both using the Caesar shift given the shift key. Entering 4 allows you to sort by alphabetical order and entering 5 allows you to sort by deadline. Entering 6 ends the program. After each "action," the updated task list will be printed in a table format, and the menu will be presented (until the user decides to quit).
